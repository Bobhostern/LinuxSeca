=========
To use this program, you must create the folders:
Saves - Where the program puts the savefiles
Results - Where it puts the result files
lib - The mandatory prerequisite folder

In the lib directory, you must have:
questions.rsbin2 - Question file
answers.rsbin2 - Answers file

You must have the "libs" folder, and these file inside it:
Check.rb - the module Check
Error.rb - the module Error
Init_core.rb - the class Init
Result.rb - the module Result
Test_core.rb - the class Test

Editor.rb is simply a barely functional editor for these two files. Do to it as you wish.

The defaults are minimal.

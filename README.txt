To use this program, you must create the folders:
Saves - Where the program puts the savefiles
Results - Where it puts the result files
lib - The mandatory prerequisite folder

In the lib directory, you must have:
questions.rsbin2 - Question file
answers.rsbin2 - Answers file

Editor.rb is simply a barely functional editor for these two files. Do to it as you wish.

The defaults are minimal.

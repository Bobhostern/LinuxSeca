Jabber is simply the name of the Java implementation of LinuxSeca.
It uses a Java library that I am making (and have yet to Javadoc), REMJava,
and there is one small change.
The "lib" folder of LinuxSeca is changed to "libx". It's just a small name
change to prevent conflicts with Jabber's "lib" folder, which is where
it places REMJava.
Well, ciao!
